# C++ Control Flow & Logic Building Practice

## 📌 About This Topic

This topics contains my **C++ Control Flow and Logic Building practice programs**.  
These problems helped me build a strong foundation in **C++ programming, logical thinking, and problem-solving**, which is essential for **DSA and Software Engineering interviews**.

All programs are written from scratch and practiced for revision and GitHub portfolio building.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen C++ fundamentals
- Improve logical thinking
- Prepare for Data Structures & Algorithms
- Build a clean coding portfolio
- Work towards my dream of becoming a **Software Engineer at Microsoft**
